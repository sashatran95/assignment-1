        <h2>Origin</h2>
        
        <p class="dropcap"><strong>Pac-Man</strong> (<strong>パックマン</strong> <em>Pakkuman?</em>) is an arcade game developed by <strong><em>Namco</em></strong> and first released in Japan on <strong>May 22, 1980</strong>. It was licensed for distribution in the United States by Midway and released in October 1980. Immensely popular from its original release to the present day, Pac-Man is considered one of the classics of the medium, virtually synonymous with video games, and an icon of 1980s popular culture. Upon its release, the game—and, subsequently, Pac-Man derivatives—became a <strong>social phenomenon</strong> that sold a large amount of merchandise and also inspired, among other things, an animated television series and a top-ten hit single.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>When Toru Iwatani hungrily stared into his <strong>pizza box</strong>, containing 2 slices short of a full pie, the idea for one of the greatest arcade games was born. At 27 years, the Japanesse student came up with the idea for Pac-Man - a game that became legend, and spawned numerous sequals and clones. At the time, electronic gaming with a business with few success stories. Games like <em>Asteroids</em>, <em>Space Invaders</em>, <em>Pong</em>, and <em>Break-out</em> were all great games, but none of them were popular with <strong>mainstream society</strong>. A year after the idea was conceived, the game was finally finished and released. It took the world by storm and soon became a household name.</p>
